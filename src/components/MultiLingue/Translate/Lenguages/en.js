In addition to studying engineering, I am a web developer with great knowledge in front-end programming. With that, in my current job, I was inserted into several projects that use some of the most famous frameworks like React Js, React Native, Angular, Flutter and WordPress. The latter, I have a high level of understanding of how it works, and, in addition to mastering this platform, I have complete mastery of some plugins such as woocommerce, elementor, etc. In addition to the frameworks used to develop my projects, I have a high level of knowledge in the following programming languages: JavaScript, Git, Html, CSS, Typescript, Dart, Python and C++. I also find it very easy to follow design prototypes (UI/UX) like the figma platform. Because I did a student exchange program in 2016 to Italy, I consider myself to have an advanced knowledge of the English language and a basic proficiency of italian one.",
